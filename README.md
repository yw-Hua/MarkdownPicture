## Overview

CStreet is a cell states trajectory inference method for time-series single-cell RNA-seq data. It is written in python (python 3.6 or higher) and is available as a commend line tool and a python library to meet the needs of different users.

CStreet takes advantage of time-series information to construct the *k*-nearest neighbors connections within and between time points. Then CStreet calculated the connection probabilities of cell states and visualized the trajectory which may include multiple starting points and paths using a force-directed layout method. 

## Installation

CStreet has been packaged and uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cstreet/). Before your installation, you'll make sure you have pip available. The pip3 is the package installer for Python. If you don't have pip3 on your machine, try [click here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install it. Then CStreet and its relevant packages can be installed using one single commands as follows.

   ```shell
   $ pip3 install cstreet 
   ```


Type the following command to check whether CStreet has been installed successfully.

   ```shell
   $ CStreet -h
   ```

## Quick Start

**Input**: 

   - Expression data: Expression matrix containing the time-series expression level as reads counts or normalized values in tab delimited format, and anndata format are accepted as the input of CStreet. (For example: ExpressionMatrix_t1.txt ExpressionMatrix_t2.txt ExpressionMatrix_t3.txt)
   - Cell states info: The cell states information can be inputted by the user or generated using the internal clustering function of CStreet. (For example: CellStates_t1.txt CellStates_t2.txt CellStates_t3.txt)

**Commandline**:

   ```shell
   $ CStreet -i ExpressionMatrix_t1.txt ExpressionMatrix_t1.txt ExpressionMatrix_t1.txt -s CellStates_t1.txt CellStates_t2.txt CellStates_t3.txt -n ProjectName
   ```

**Output**: 

The contents of the output directory in tree format will be displayed as follows:
